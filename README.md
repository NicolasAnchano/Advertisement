# Advertisement

In this project, we'll aim to find the two best markets to advertise our product in â€” we're working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.

First, we'll find which kind of courses are the most popular ones. Then, we'll explore countries with a high presence on the site. Lastly, we'll determine how willing are the customers on those countries to spend on our platform. That way, we'll find which ones we should focus are advertisements and marketing campaigns on.
